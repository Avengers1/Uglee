This is Uglee. Uglee is a dwarven fighter/priest of Gwar. His is stupid and strong as an ox. 
He is now also a TT.FM bot. 

While this is mostly for my learning and fun, feel free to use him in your own chatrooms. 

This project utilizes the [Turntable-API](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API). 
Go there to learn how to setup Node.js then you can run this project. Make a copy of `config.sample.json` 
and rename that copy to `config.json`. Also make a copy of `actions.sample.js` and rename that copy to 
`actions.js`. Edit the document filling in the information required.

You can edit the `actions.js` I have or completely change the listing.
